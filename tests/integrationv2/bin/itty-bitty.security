# TLS key limits on symmetric cryptographic algorithms
#
# This security property sets limits on algorithms key usage in TLS 1.3.
# When the amount of data encrypted exceeds the algorithm value listed below,
# a KeyUpdate message will trigger a key change.  This is for symmetric ciphers
# with TLS 1.3 only.
#
# The syntax for the property is described below:
#   KeyLimits:
#       " KeyLimit { , KeyLimit } "
#
#   WeakKeyLimit:
#       AlgorithmName Action Length
#
#   AlgorithmName:
#       A full algorithm transformation.
#
#   Action:
#       KeyUpdate
#
#   Length:
#       The amount of encrypted data in a session before the Action occurs
#       This value may be an integer value in bytes, or as a power of two, 2^29.
#
#   KeyUpdate:
#       The TLS 1.3 KeyUpdate handshake process begins when the Length amount
#       is fulfilled.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by OpenJDK's JSSE implementation. It
# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
