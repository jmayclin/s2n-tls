The callback\n can be used by clients to validate server certificates, or by servers to validate client certificates in the case of\n mutual auth. Note that any validation performed by applications in the callback is in addition to the certificate\n validation already performed by s2n-tls.\n\n Applications can use either of the following APIs from within the callback to retrieve the peer's certificate chain\n and perform validation before proceeding with the handshake:\n  - `s2n_connection_get_peer_cert_chain()`\n  - `s2n_connection_get_client_cert_chain()`\n\n If the validation performed in the callback is successful, `s2n_cert_validation_accept()` MUST be called to allow\n `s2n_negotiate()` to continue the handshake. If the validation is unsuccessful, `s2n_cert_validation_reject()`\n MUST be called, which will cause `s2n_negotiate()` to error.\n\n To use the validation callback asynchronously, return `S2N_SUCCESS` without calling `s2n_cert_validation_accept()`\n or `s2n_cert_validation_reject()`. This will pause the handshake, and `s2n_negotiate()` will throw an `S2N_ERR_T_BLOCKED`\n error and `s2n_blocked_status` will be set to `S2N_BLOCKED_ON_APPLICATION_INPUT`.

The `info` argument shares the same lifetime as\n `s2n_connection`.\n\n After calling `s2n_cert_validation_reject()`, `s2n_negotiate()` will fail with a protocol error indicating that\n the cert has been rejected from the callback.
